In fact, the AZ biologics pipeline and resultant demand it places on manufacturing is growing beyond industry norms. The company has a robust pipeline of more than 120 biologics, including more than 30 in clinical development. Based in Gaithersburg, U.S., Global Biologics Operations is responsible for developing candidates from drug substance to drug product -- getting innovative new medicines to the patients who urgently need them. With manufacturing sites in Europe and the U.S, the Biologics network is rapidly expanding to meet burgeoning demand for its Monoclonal antibody (mAb) and vaccine products. **About the Boulder Manufacturing Center** Our initial plan is to restart the facility with two 15,000-liter mammalian cell culture bioreactors, which we plan to have fully operational in mid-2017. We are reviewing a number of strategies for the Boulder facility, so a final decision hasn't been made. The most likely scenario would be to have large scale, continuous production for 1-2 of the bigger projects coming from our pipeline. Each of the scenarios we are looking at involves investments into this facility, so it will play a big role in our plans for the future. **About our People and Culture** AstraZeneca employees represent a variety of cultures, ethnicities, languages and beliefs. We are fostering an environment of collaboration and smart risk taking, where people can work autonomously and with accountability to take and implement decisions with pace and support. We offer an innovative environment that fosters growth and learning. **How Biologics Operations and MedImmune are connected** AstraZeneca acquired MedImmune in 2007. Today, MedImmune operates as the biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. In 2013, AstraZeneca moved MedImmune's Operations function into its own Global Operations Department to better align the financial and capital resources needed to deliver the company's robust research and development pipeline. Despite this split, Biologics Operations remains intricately involved in MedImmune's biopharmaceutical development, working closely with researchers and scientists to produce clinical trial product and ensure quality manufacturing procedures to deliver medicines to patients. Delivering medicines to patients with unmet needs remains a consistent goal for all Global Operations employees. While we continue to invest in the infrastructure needed to integrate the Global Operations into one organization, we will, for the foreseeable future have employees on different email and HR systems. *DISCLAIMERS/NOTICES:* AstraZeneca and MedImmune do not accept non-solicited resumes or candidate submittals from search/recruiting agencies not already on an approved agency list.

Examples of the kinds of work you might end up doing on this team: Build and operate reliable, large-scale distributed systems - eg. Develop a service in C# to reliably manage and distribute work to tens of thousands of VMs in Azure. - eg. Design and implement a Bit Torrent-like peer-to-peer protocol in C# to efficiently distribute large data blobs to hundreds of machines. - eg.

Occasionally get a call at 11 PM that a customer email is getting delayed because of our service; trawl through logs, run tests, trace the propagation of a specific job through dozens of services to find where the problem is and find a way to repair it. Build and automate Sysinternals type tools - eg. Write a C# library to capture and filter Windows ETW events and correlate them with SysMon events. - eg. Write a C++ detours hook library to inject into a process to take a crash dump of it just before it exits. Analyze exploit and malware samples and develop new tools and heuristics to detect them - eg. Figure out a way to get hold of malware samples that do sandbox evasion, study them, and conceive & implement ways to fool them into executing as if they were on a real machine. - eg. Debug Excel to figure out why loading an Excel file would cause it to create a remote thread in a system process. - eg. Experiment to find the best way to apply Machine Learning to the problem of classifying malware. Find ever better and more efficient ways of isolating malware - eg. Come up with creative ways to rapidly reset an Azure VM to a clean state with a guarantee that malware cannot persist, faster than Azure can itself create VMs. - eg. Inspect perf traces of and debug Hyper-Vs interaction with the Windows Memory Manager to figure out what the bottleneck is when creating hundreds of VMs in parallel and work with Hyper-V team to eliminate it. Mine big data sources and build data pipelines - eg. Construct Scope and/or SQL queries to search hundreds of millions of detonation results for samples with a common behavior, and then correlate those with data from other Microsoft systems. - eg. Look through thousands of examples of behaviors observed while running malware in our sandbox, reason about how they might appear on a host IDS or a network edge device, and then build a workflow that gets that data to those other Microsoft systems in near real time.
